## About project
Not so long time ago in not so far galaxy... 

I once had the idea to make a thermometer with temperature measurement in degrees celsius. The design was to display the temperature according to the measured temperature and display it in the appropriate color on a medium-sized display. Depending on the temperature, a different color was to be used. The device was to save the measurements on an SD card and and synchronize them with a server via LAN. I pulled the project in parallel with other tasks and it did not live to be implemented ending up as a failed prototype. Years passed and I decided to see if I could still write the code for that solution and if so make the results available to the public.

The project will be created in the form of individual files ino for android and each of them is to be a test of the solution.
